## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, SPPD is maintained under the [Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See [the Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/feinwarusoftware/sppd/releases) for changelogs for each release version of SPPD. Release announcement posts on [our Discord server](https://discord.feinwaru.com) contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.

If possible we plan to update the website within a few days of new information being available alongside hotfixes released as required.
